### AI Usage

For this assignment, I used **OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT (GPT-5)** as a study and support tool.

**How I used AI**

- Explain important Android development concepts (e.g., remember, rememberSaveable, Scaffold, by delegation), which helped me better understand lecture examples.
- I provided sample classroom code and requested **step-by-step explanations** of why certain behaviors (such as recomposition or state handling) occur.
- I shared parts of my own Compose code and asked AI for **suggestions to improve UI clarity and layout**, such as adding padding, background colors, borders, and better text alignment.



- **What I kept**

  

  - I used the **conceptual explanations** and **ui improvement suggestions** to refine my own implementation.
  - I reused short snippets (e.g., modifier combinations for padding/border/size) but **rewrote them in my own structure** to fit assignment requirements.

  

- **What I discarded**

  

  - I did not copy AI-generated solutions.
